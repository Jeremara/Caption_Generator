# Caption_Generator
This project is straightly based on using API to generate caption based on the user's image input for Social Media.
In this project, I uses Streamlit framework to display the GUI of the project.

Build_up of the project:

- python 3.12
- streamlit
- PIL
- APIS: 
  https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base
  
  https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1

If you intend to build similar project, you get the above models from @haggingface or copy the various APIS in your browser.
